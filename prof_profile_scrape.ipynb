      "<p>Dr. Dvijesh Shastri is an Associate Professor of Computer Science at the University of Houston – Downtown. He specializes in affective computing, human behavior analysis, and data analytics. He has developed many computer vision and image processing algorithms that capture physiological signals from thermal imagery and associate them with human psychological states; these algorithms offer a novel toolkit for human behavior analysis. He has developed a novel non-contact way of measuring emotional perspiration responses from the face, which is a completely different approach from the contact-based clinical standard of measuring perspiration from fingers. This method allows realistic psychophysiological studies where subjects can operate naturally. His research on contact-free polygraph machine was demonstrated on primetime CNN news, Wolf Blitzer's Situation Room, and broadcasted on the Discovery Science channel in 2009. Dr. Shastri has co-authored more than twenty-five publications in premier conference and journals. He has been PI and CO-PI for multiple internal and external grants. He received a B.E. in Electrical Engineering from Sardar Patel University in 1997, an M.S. in Computer Science from Wright State University in 2001, and Ph.D. in Computer Science from the University of Houston in 2007.<br/></p>\n",
